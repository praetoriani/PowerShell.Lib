.SYNOPSIS
    SysDaemon Job Script - Demo script executed by the scheduled task
    
.DESCRIPTION
    ⚠️  WARNING: THIS IS A DEMO SCRIPT! ⚠️
    
    This is a sample implementation that demonstrates the basic structure
    of a SysDaemon job script. This script currently only creates a simple
    timestamp file to prove execution.
    
    🔧 USER ACTION REQUIRED:
    You MUST customize this script according to your specific requirements.
    Replace the demo functionality below with your actual business logic,
    system tasks, or automation procedures.
    
    The script is executed by the Windows Task Scheduler via SysDaemon
    and runs under SYSTEM context with no console window.
    
.USAGE
    This script is typically called by the Windows Task Scheduler via SysDaemon.
    Manual execution: .\sysdaemon.job.ps1

    ⚠️  IMPORTANT CUSTOMIZATION NOTICE:
    This demo script only creates a timestamp file. For production use,
    you must replace the content below with your specific automation tasks.

# ============================================================================
# ⚠️  DEMO SCRIPT - REPLACE THIS CONTENT WITH YOUR ACTUAL TASKS! ⚠️
# ============================================================================

# Get script directory and define target file
$ScriptDir = Split-Path -Parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path
$TrackingFile = Join-Path $ScriptDir "sysdaemon.job.txt"

# Generate timestamp in the required format
$Timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyy.MM.dd - HH:mm:ss"

# Create the content string with timestamp first, then emoji
$Content = "⏱️[$Timestamp] File sysdaemon.job.ps1 was executed 🚀"

try {
    # Create or overwrite the tracking file with UTF8-BOM encoding
    $Content | Out-File -FilePath $TrackingFile -Encoding UTF8 -Force
    
    # Verify file was created successfully (optional verification)
    if (Test-Path $TrackingFile) {
        # Success - file created/updated
        # No output since this runs as scheduled task under SYSTEM context
    }
} catch {
    # Error handling for demo script
    # In production, implement proper error logging and notification
    # Consider writing to Windows Event Log or sending alerts
}

# ============================================================================
# 🔧 REPLACE ABOVE WITH YOUR CUSTOM AUTOMATION TASKS:
#
# Examples of what you might implement here:
# - System maintenance tasks
# - File synchronization operations  
# - Database cleanup procedures
# - Security monitoring scripts
# - Backup operations
# - Service health checks
# - Configuration updates
# - Report generation
# - API integrations
# - Data processing workflows
#
# Remember: This script runs under SYSTEM context without user interaction
